# Sokoban

A tiny [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) game to try out some tech.

I wanted to see how [Hybrid.js](https://hybrids.js.org/) feels to write a non trivial UI and try [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) to run the dev server.

I'll write a post on [my blog](https://terry.gonguet.com/blog) to recount my experience making this small game.
